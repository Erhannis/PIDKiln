dithering?
max power?

I got some weird D behavior in a sim derived from the pid lib, like, it wasn't damping right.
  Also, I never got PoM working right after updating the scaling

Make decimals consistent
hard caps
(tuning: I don't know how it reacts to an abrupt change)

program finish -> start program, acted like it was running the program (up to 100% heat time), but elements weren't on.  Thought I'd burned out my elements.
I think maybe you need to loadProgram for it to reset properly?
Don't permit load program while program already running!
End program vs abort?

^separate pid and element windows
^rescale pid to 0-1
^PID SetSampleTime
^PID scale default params by 0.0378
^permit change PID during program?
^additional power limits by temperature
  power *= (1350-temp)/1350
    configurable max?  minimum cap?
^chart power
^scale PID graph 0-1
^Update pidkiln.conf in git with scaled Kx
^NANs propagate and persist
  ^does the PID get infected?
^stop program if too many NANs?
  ^should probably be counted a tc fail
^fix PID tuning
