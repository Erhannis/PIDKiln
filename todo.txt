fix PID tuning
dithering?
max power?
chart power
^NANs propagate and persist
  does the PID get infected?
stop program if too many NANs?

I got some weird D behavior in a sim derived from the pid lib, like, it wasn't damping right. 

Update pidkiln.conf in git with scaled Kx

^separate pid and element windows
^rescale pid to 0-1
^PID SetSampleTime
^PID scale default params by 0.0378
^permit change PID during program?
^additional power limits by temperature
  power *= (1350-temp)/1350
    configurable max?  minimum cap?

program finish -> start program, acted like it was running the program (up to 100% heat time), but elements weren't on.  Thought I'd burned out my elements.
