fix PID tuning
permit change PID during program?
dithering?
max power?
additional power limits by temperature
  power *= (1350-temp)/1350
    configurable max?  minimum cap?
chart power
NANs propagate and persist
stop program if too many NANs?

I think the pid window shouldn't be changed during run?  (5000 -> 250 maxed my element out rather than proportionally speeding up)
I also got some weird D behavior in a sim derived from the pid lib, like, it wasn't damping right.
