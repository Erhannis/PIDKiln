fix PID tuning
permit change PID during program?
dithering?
max power?
additional power limits by temperature
  power *= (1350-temp)/1350
    configurable max?  minimum cap?
chart power
NANs propagate and persist
  does the PID get infected?
stop program if too many NANs?

I think the pid window shouldn't be changed during run?  (5000 -> 250 maxed my element out rather than proportionally speeding up)
I also got some weird D behavior in a sim derived from the pid lib, like, it wasn't damping right. 

^propagate new variables
^replace pid_out

wait, does pid window actually even affect pid?  is divider the thing I want??
  well, it's not passed to the PID!
separate pid and element windows
rescale pid to 0-1
PID_WINDOW_DIVIDER
  is NOT used in timing the windows

program finish -> start program, acted like it was running the program (up to 100% heat time), but elements weren't on.  Thought I'd burned out my elements.
