Tagged a bunch of changes with //PCB

Install https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MAX31856

Switched from WROVER to WROOM
Alarm is now pin 33, one of the breakouts
Energy monitor pin defaults to 34, one of the breakouts
Disabled LCD and INPUT because those pins are attached to other things
  (You might be able to use some of the breakout pins for these.  Not sure there are enough.)
SSRs 1-3 are now pins 25-27
EMR is now 32
Thermocouple is now MAX31856
