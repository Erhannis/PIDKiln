Changes made in the switch to the Erhannis PCB
----
Tagged a bunch of changes with //PCB

Switched from WROVER to WROOM
Alarm is now pin 33, one of the breakouts
Energy monitor pin defaults to 34, one of the breakouts
Disabled LCD and INPUT because those pins are attached to other things
  (You might be able to use some of the breakout pins for these.  Not sure there are enough.)
